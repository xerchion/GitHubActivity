# GitHub Activity CLI

## Description
This project involves a command-line interface (CLI) to fetch and display the recent activity of a GitHub user directly in the terminal. The CLI retrieves data from the GitHub API based on a username, processes the JSON response, and presents the activity in a clear and user-friendly format.



This project is part of the [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/) backend learning path. It serves as a hands-on exercise to reinforce concepts and skills in backend development.


## Usage
To execute the commands, the `python GitHubActivity.py` command should be followed by the appropriate subcommands and arguments based on the operation you wish to perform.

### Example

`python GitHubActivity.py xerchion`


### Technical Notes


- **Programming Paradigm**:
This project is designed using object-oriented programming principles, ensuring modularity and reusability of code. Pydantic is used to structure the data from the GitHub API, allowing me to learn and leverage this powerful tool.

- **Testing**:
Unit tests are written using pytest and unittest to ensure functionality and catch issues early. Test coverage is monitored using coverage to ensure that all parts of the codebase are adequately tested.

- **Code Quality**:
The project adheres to best practices in programming, including consistent code style and design patterns. Type hinting is employed for code clarity and to assist in maintaining a clear and understandable codebase.
- **Linting**: Code linting tools are used to enforce coding standards and improve code quality. Type checking is utilized to catch potential type errors and enhance code readability.
